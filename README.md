# üçΩÔ∏è Recipe Recommendation System & Sentiment Analysis  
**University of San Diego ‚Äî AAI 510 (Team 8 Final Project)**  

---

## üß† Project Overview
This project builds an intelligent **culinary recommendation platform** that predicts user preferences and analyzes recipe reviews.  
It merges **collaborative filtering** and **sentiment analysis (NLP)** to deliver personalized and meaningful recipe suggestions.  

> üéØ Goal: Enhance user engagement by combining **recommendation systems** with **opinion mining**.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Recommend recipes using both user history and ingredient similarity.  
- Perform sentiment analysis on user reviews to understand preferences.  

---

## üß© Dataset
**Food.com Dataset** ‚Äî contains over **500,000 recipes** and **1.4 million user reviews**.

Each entry includes:
- Recipe ID, Name, Ingredients, and Tags  
- User Reviews and Ratings (1‚Äì5)  
- Review Text for sentiment analysis

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned and normalized text data (stopword removal, lemmatization).  
- Built user‚Äìitem matrices for collaborative filtering.  
- Tokenized ingredient lists for semantic similarity modeling.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Recommendation System
**Collaborative Filtering (SVD):**
- Generated latent factors using **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**.  
- Calculated **cosine similarity** between user and item vectors.  
- Predicted unseen ratings based on top-N similar items.

**Content-Based Filtering (Word2Vec):**
- Used **Word2Vec embeddings** to capture ingredient similarity.  
- Recommended similar recipes for first-time (cold-start) users.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Sentiment Analysis
- Classified review text polarity using traditional and neural models.  
- Models used:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Na√Øve Bayes  
  - Bi-LSTM (for contextual understanding)  
- Evaluated using **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-score**.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation
- **RMSE** for rating prediction accuracy.  
- **Precision@K / Recall@K** for recommender performance.  
- **F1-score** for sentiment classification.
